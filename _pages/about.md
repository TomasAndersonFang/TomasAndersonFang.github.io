Hello! I'm now a second-year Ph.D. student in NC State University, advised by Prof. [Bowen Xu](https://www.bowenxu.me/). Before joining NC State, I was a research engineer at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). I obtained a Master's degree from Central China Normal University. I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, with a particular focus on AI4SE, LLM4Code, and SE4AI.

My current research addresses a critical gap in LLM evaluation: how to fairly assess robustness without relying on biased adversarial attacks. We developed [EvaLooop](https://evalooop.github.io/), a novel framework that evaluates LLM stability through iterative self-consistency loops. By testing how models maintain semantic integrity across repeated code generation and summarization cycles, we have evaluated 100+ mainstream LLMs and discovered that high initial accuracy does not guarantee sustained reliability. Explore our comprehensive [leaderboard](https://evalooop.github.io/) for detailed rankings and insights.

In my leisure time, I enjoy Japanese Anime and channeling my creativity into writing novels. Additionally, I have a passion for exploring different computer games. A heartfelt thanks to my sweetheart Kiki, whose generosity has expanded my gaming adventures with numerous new additions to my collection.
