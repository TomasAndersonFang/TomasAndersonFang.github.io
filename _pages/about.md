Hello! I am a research engineer at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). I obtained a Master's degree from Central China Normal University. I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, with a particular focus on AI4SE, LLM4Code, and SE4AI.

My current research primarily revolves around program repair, specifically investigating the effective utilization of LLMs in developing practical, automated program repair models. For those who share an interest in this topic, I invite you to explore my latest work, [RepairLLaMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15698), which provides insights and advancements in this domain.

In my leisure time, I enjoy Japanese Anime and channeling my creativity into writing novels. Additionally, I have a passion for exploring different computer games. A heartfelt thanks to my sweetheart Kiki, whose generosity has expanded my gaming adventures with numerous new additions to my collection.
