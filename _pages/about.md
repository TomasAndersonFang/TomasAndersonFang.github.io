Hello! I'm now a second-year Ph.D. student in NC State University, advised by Prof. [Bowen Xu](https://www.bowenxu.me/). Before joining NC State, I was a research engineer at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Prof. [Martin Monperrus](https://www.monperrus.net/martin/). I obtained a Master's degree from Central China Normal University. I am deeply fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, with a particular focus on AI4SE, LLM4Code, and SE4AI.

My current research primarily revolves around robustness evaluation, specifically proposing a unified and fair framework ([EvaLooop](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.12185v4)) for assessing LLM robustness in programming through self-consistency loops. we are actively maintaining a leaderboard with the results on more than 100 LLMs. Check it out at https://evalooop.github.io/.

In my leisure time, I enjoy Japanese Anime and channeling my creativity into writing novels. Additionally, I have a passion for exploring different computer games. A heartfelt thanks to my sweetheart Kiki, whose generosity has expanded my gaming adventures with numerous new additions to my collection.
